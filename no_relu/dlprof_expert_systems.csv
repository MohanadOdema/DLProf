Problem,Recommendation
"5 ops were eligible to use tensor cores but none are using FP16","Try enabling AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision). For more information: https://developer.nvidia.com/automatic-mixed-precision"
"The GPU is underutilized: Only 0.0% of the profiled time is spent on GPU kernel operations","CPU has the highest (non-GPU) usage at 78.9%. Consider swapping ops that are running on the CPU for equivalent GPU ops"
"No DALI ops detected","Consider using NVIDIA DALI, a library that is a high performance alternative to built-in data loaders and data iterators. Learn more here: https://developer.nvidia.com/DALI"
"Unable to split profile into training iterations: key op  not found","Specify key op by setting the --key_op argument"
